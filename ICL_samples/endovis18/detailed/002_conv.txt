The kidney occupies the upper and central part of the operative view, with instruments positioned around it. The prograsp forceps on the right/upper-right is actively manipulating tissue, providing traction and stabilizing structures near the kidney. A suction instrument approaches from the left and is also actively manipulating tissue and maintaining the operative field. A stapler is present on the right side and oriented toward the central operative region but is not being fired in this instant, suggesting it is being positioned or readied. The bipolar forceps is visible on the left/upper-left but not actively engaged at this moment. Thread and clamps are visible in the field, although active suturing is not the focus in this specific frame.
