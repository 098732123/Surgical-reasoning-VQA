The kidney occupies the upper portion of the operative view, while multiple instruments are positioned in the lower and right portions of the frame. A large needle driver and bipolar forceps are actively looping and controlling a visible suture thread, consistent with active suture handling. The prograsp forceps is positioned toward the right/upper-right and is manipulating tissue, likely stabilizing the field or presenting tissue to facilitate controlled suture management. A clip applier is present in the lower/central region but is not being deployed at this instant. Clamps are also visible in the field, and no cutting action is evident in this frame.
