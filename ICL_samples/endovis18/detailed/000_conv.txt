The kidney dominates the central-to-upper field of view, while small intestine is visible in the lower portion of the frame. Multiple instruments surround the operative target: bipolar forceps approaches from the left/upper-left, prograsp forceps from the lower-left, and a suction instrument from the right, all engaged in tissue handling and traction from different directions to improve exposure. Monopolar curved scissors are visible on the right side but are not actively cutting in this instant. Overall, the scene is most consistent with active exposure and controlled tissue handling around the kidney with bowel in view inferiorly.
