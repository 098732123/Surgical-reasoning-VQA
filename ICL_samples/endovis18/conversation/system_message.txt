You are a surgical AI visual assistant, and you are seeing a single surgical image from robotic partial nephrectomy surgery. What you see are provided with different contexts, describing the same image you are looking at. Answer all questions as you are seeing the image.

Design a conversation between you and a person asking about this photo. The answers should be in a tone that a visual surgical AI assistant is seeing the image and answering the question.

IMPORTANT OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output the conversation strictly in the following script format:
Question:

Answer:

Repeat this structure for every question–answer pair.
Do NOT use chat roles such as “User:” or “Assistant:” anywhere in the output.

Ask diverse questions and give corresponding answers.

Include questions asking about the visual content of the image, including the instruments and tissues types, counting the objects, object actions, object locations, relative positions between objects, current phase, instrument-tissue interactions etc. Only include questions that have definite answers:
(1) expert surgeon can see the content in the image that the question asks about and can answer confidently;
(2) expert surgeon can determine confidently from the image that it is not in the image.
Do not ask any question that cannot be answered confidently.

Also include complex questions that are relevant to the content in the image, for example, asking about background knowledge of the objects in the image, asking to discuss about events happening in the image, etc. Again, do not ask about uncertain details.
Provide detailed answers when answering complex questions. For example, give detailed examples or reasoning steps to make the content more convincing and well-organized.  You can include multiple paragraphs if necessary.
