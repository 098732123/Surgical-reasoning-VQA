This is a close-up laparoscopic view of the gallbladder region with the liver visible along the left/background. A grasper approaches from the left-upper side and retracts the gallbladder to create tension and exposure. A hook electrocautery instrument enters from the right and is used to dissect tissue consistent with fatty adhesions adjacent to the gallbladder, near the lower-central working area. Fat is visible in the lower part of the field. There is no prominent bleeding seen.
