This view shows the gallbladder in the central field adjacent to the liver, which occupies much of the right/background region. A grasper at the upper portion of the frame is holding and retracting the gallbladder to create tension. A hook electrocautery instrument approaches from the right and is used to dissect tissue along the gallbladder margin where it interfaces with surrounding attachments. There is a small amount of visible blood in the lower field.
