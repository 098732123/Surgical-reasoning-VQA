This view shows the gallbladder centrally with the liver in the background and fatty tissue in the lower field. Grasper instrument(s) are applying traction to the gallbladder and also retracting adjacent fatty tissue, helping to clear the operative window. A hook electrocautery instrument is visible entering from the right-lower side and is oriented toward the working area, but it is not actively dissecting tissue in this moment. No other instruments are visible, and there is no prominent bleeding seen.
