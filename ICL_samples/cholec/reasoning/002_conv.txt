Question:
Why is dissecting fatty adhesions helpful at this point in the operation?
===
Answer:
In this frame, fatty adhesions appear to be present while the gallbladder is under traction. Dissecting adhesions while traction is applied helps open tissue planes and improves exposure. This allows the surgeon to progressively clear the operative window and safely advance the dissection by maintaining tension and visibility rather than pulling blindly through attachments.

Question:
What adverse event risk increases if the dissection strays away from the intended plane at this stage?
===
Answer:
In this frame, hook dissection appears to be occurring close to the gallbladder and nearby organs. If the dissection strays, there is increased risk of collateral thermal injury or mechanical injury such as bleeding from liver bed tissue, gallbladder wall perforation with bile spillage, or injury to nearby non-target tissue. These events can worsen visualization and may increase postoperative complications such as infection or bile leak.

Question:
As dissection progresses, what key safety milestone should be achieved before moving on to definitive duct or artery clipping and division?
===
Answer:
In this moment, ongoing dissection appears to be focused on defining anatomy around the gallbladder. The surgeon should achieve the critical view of safety by clearly defining the relevant structures and ensuring the correct anatomy is identified before clipping and dividing, as this is a major strategy to reduce the risk of bile duct injury.
